# A Car Dual 12V Lead Acid Batteries Charging Device

## Description

A smart battery management system for vehicles that prevents dead batteries while extending functionality. This device monitors the primary car battery (>40Ahr) voltage and automatically switches to a secondary battery (e.g., 20Ahr) for powering accessories when the car is off, preventing the main battery from running flat.

## Key Features

- Monitors primary battery voltage and disconnects it when voltage drops below 12.5V
- Automatically switches to secondary battery for powering accessories (lights, music, etc.)
- Disconnects secondary battery when voltage drops below 11.5V to preserve power for alarm and central locking
- Maximum charging current of 2A for the secondary battery during normal driving
- Complete isolation of secondary battery from alternator
- Optional touchscreen or web-server display for monitoring system parameters

## Benefits

- Prevents frustrating dead battery situations when lights or music are left on
- Anti-theft feature: primary battery always disconnected when not in use
- Safe monitoring and control of primary battery
- Extended power capacity for accessories without risking vehicle starting ability
- Perfect for vehicles with power-hungry accessories or extended periods of non-use

## Technical Requirements

- Dual 12V lead acid battery management
- Primary battery (>40Ahr) preserved for starting the vehicle
- Secondary battery (20Ahr) dedicated to accessories
- Automatic voltage monitoring and switching logic
- Maximum 2A charging rate for secondary battery

## Development Status

Project in planning phase. Contributions welcome.
